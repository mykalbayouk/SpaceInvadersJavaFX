Basic Description
*****************

The goal of this project was to implement, from scratch, a recreation of "Space Invaders" in Java 17 using JavaFX 17
that incorporates a preponderance of the topics introduced in my cs1302 course in a way that
demonstrates that I have met the learning outcomes related to those topics.


Learning Outcomes
*****************

Here are some of the learning outcomes for this project:

* Plan, design, implement, test, debug, and deploy a complete object-oriented software solution in Linux/Unix environment (1302-LO1).
* Utilize inheritance and polymorphism in a software project (1302-LO3-LO4).
* Develop a GUI for a software project (1302-LO7).
* Implement exception-handling in a software project (1302-LO8).
