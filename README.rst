Basic Description
*****************

Your goal is to implement, from scratch, a GUI application in Java 17 using JavaFX 17
that incorporates a preponderance of the topics introduced in this course in a way that
demonstrates that you have met the learning outcomes related to those topics.

Arcade Game
   Find a classic |arcade_game|_ that interests you and implement your own version
   of it. The visuals and game mechanics must be easily recognizable and consistent with
   traditional implementations of the game you chose. You are required to utilize either
   keyboard event handlers or mouse event handlers that aren't related to one or
   more buttons. Some examples of arcade games we have seen in the past include: Tetris,
   Frogger, Snake, Asteroids, and many others. Other games such as Minesweeper, Connect 4,
   Checkers, and Chess would not be considered arcade games and would not be valid options
   for a final project. If you have a game you are thinking of implementing and are unsure
   of whether or not it is allowed, please ask!
