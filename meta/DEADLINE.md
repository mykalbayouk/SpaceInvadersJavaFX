    I have created an adaptation of the classic Arcade Game "Space Invaders". When the game starts you
    must use the left arrow key to move left and the right arrow key to move right. Spacebar
    will allow you to shoot your rocket in order to defeat all the aliens. Once all the aliens are defeated
    you have won. But, if you lose all three of your lives it's Game Over! Once you reach the end screen, press
    enter to restart the game.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I have learned how important it is to get many objects to work together through many classes. Also how somewhat annoying it can be
    to look through javadoc websites for hours but also how rewarding it is to have your little rocket make an alien dissapear. Overall,
    I feel like I have become a much stronger and effiecent coder due to the fact i am able to decipher and make a plan on what i need to do
    a lot more quickly than starting this semester. Also, im very excited to do more game develop in the future with stuff such as unity or
    unreal engine.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I think that I would try and just develop my own sprite for everything because dealing with backgrounds and royalty images
    was way more of a hassle then i would have liked. Also I think I would want to become more familar with how scene graphs and
    staging works because that led to a lot of issues with customazation.
